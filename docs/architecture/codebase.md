# Codebase architecture

> **Status:** Current implementation. [`scripts/lib/workspace-architecture.mjs`](../../scripts/lib/workspace-architecture.mjs), package manifests, export surfaces, and boundary checks are authoritative.

Nerve is a ten-package pnpm workspace. Paths communicate ownership: domain contracts are separate from runtime mechanics, product runtimes compose reusable libraries, and platform shells sit at the edge.

Arrows in the diagram mean “is consumed by.” `website` is standalone.

| `contracts`        | Transport-neutral schemas, events, operations, snapshots, and domain records                |
| `protocol`         | Sessions, RPC, replay, streams, backpressure, reconnect, and transport adapters             |

| `ui-kit`           | Contract-free shadcn primitives, generic composites, renderers, display helpers, and styles |
| `workbench-server` | HTTP/WebSocket adapters, persistence, host use cases, tasks, tools, and run coordination    |
| `workbench-app`    | Svelte composition, application workflows, vertical features, platform adapters, and UI     |
| `desktop-shell`    | Electron lifecycle, daemon supervision, IPC, windows, tray, and packaging                   |

## Naming

- TypeScript paths are kebab-case; Svelte/Astro components are PascalCase; Rust modules are snake_case.
- Name files for concepts, not merely `types`, `state`, `helpers`, `utils`, or `operations`.
- `*.service.ts` is a cohesive multi-operation domain/application service.
- `*.repository.ts` owns authoritative record access; `*.store.ts` owns mutable in-memory/client state.
- `*.adapter.ts` translates across a boundary; `*.policy.ts` makes pure decisions.
- `index.ts` is a curated public boundary, never an internal import shortcut.
- Avoid `common`, `shared`, and broad `utils` directories. Reusable code belongs to a named technical or domain area.
- Small domains remain flat; add layer subdirectories only when they improve navigation.
- Cohesive exceptions remain intentional: UI-kit `utils.ts`, domain-local `operations.ts`, curated `index.ts` boundaries, test-support helpers, narrowly scoped tools/server contract modules, and the desktop daemon composition boundary. `scripts/lib/source-naming-policy.mjs` is the complete authoritative inventory for production `types.ts`, `state.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `utils.ts`, `operations.ts`, and `composition.ts` exceptions; every new occurrence requires architecture review and an explicit inventory update.

## Runtime composition boundaries

- `workbench-server` composes domain services in `app/bootstrap`; `RuntimeLifecycle` privately owns hydration, maintenance, and domain shutdown. Bootstrap projects that graph into prebound protocol, snapshot, WebSocket, and HTTP capability contexts, so adapters cannot use `RuntimeServices` or process lifecycle as a service locator. Run-runtime modules depend only on run-local modules, contracts, and `core/ports`.
- `workbench-app` keeps mutable feature stores private. Workspace workflows consume application-owned readonly feature ports and named commands; composition installs and unregisters concrete implementations plus reverse selection/tab inputs. Presentation remains stateless and isolated from application, feature, and platform state.
- `desktop-shell/main.ts` performs bootstrap safety, single-instance acquisition, and concrete runtime construction. `DesktopRuntime` owns Electron/daemon lifetime state and listener disposal through injected ports with idempotent `start()`/`dispose()`; window policy, network configuration, direct process spawning, systemd policy, and diagnostic capture live in focused adapters.

## Enforced surfaces

Package export allowlists live in [`scripts/lib/package-export-surfaces.mjs`](../../scripts/lib/package-export-surfaces.mjs). Contracts, protocol, harness, and tools expose curated concept subpaths rather than broad implementation roots. `pnpm build` verifies every declared concrete build target and each wildcard target after production artifacts are generated. Website token parity is checked at build/check time without adding a runtime UI-kit dependency.

The canonical package inventory and allowed workspace dependencies live in [`scripts/lib/workspace-architecture.mjs`](../../scripts/lib/workspace-architecture.mjs). Package-specific `AGENTS.md` and README files define stricter local ownership rules. [`scripts/check-package-boundaries.mjs`](../../scripts/check-package-boundaries.mjs) enforces package exports, direct contracts source ownership, the generic-source-name inventory, runtime ports, feature privacy, presentation isolation, retired paths, and cross-owner cycle rules.
