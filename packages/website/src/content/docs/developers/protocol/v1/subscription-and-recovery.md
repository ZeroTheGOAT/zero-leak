A `StreamCursor` is `{ stream, processedSeq }`. It means every sequenced event through `processedSeq` has been successfully applied for that stream.

## Resume

Reconnect does not carry cursors in `hello`. After ready, the client sends its current exact cursor set through `stream.subscription.set`. The server resolves each cursor against `{ latestSeq, earliestAvailableSeq }`:

- equal to `latestSeq`: `live`;
- behind but still retained: `replay`;
- ahead of `latestSeq`, or older than `earliestAvailableSeq - 1`: `snapshot_required`;
- unknown to the server (for example a deleted conversation): `unavailable`.

For replay, the server reads from `processedSeq + 1` in bounded dense pages. Events arriving while that stream replays are buffered and released afterward. Streams recover independently.

An `unavailable` stream is excluded from activation without rejecting the rest of the set. The client drops its cursor and dependent state; a stale stream must never be able to silence live delivery for the remaining streams. Client subscription synchronization is self-healing: a sync that cannot run (session not ready) or fails stays dirty and is retried until the desired set is acknowledged.

## Defensive gaps

The client validates dense continuity even after the server accepted a subscription. If a batch starts after the expected next sequence, the client does not advance its cursor and automatically reinstalls subscriptions from the last applied cursor.

## Snapshots

For `snapshot_required`, the application loads the authorized workspace or conversation snapshot for that stream, installs snapshot state first, installs the snapshot cursor, and then resubscribes. Transient `conversation.live.*` notifications are intentionally absent from replay: active turns, draft progress, and bounded output come from the conversation snapshot, while partial state is discarded after a server crash.

Reducer lifecycle violations use the same recovery boundary: mark state corrupted, remove or suspend the affected stream, load a fresh snapshot, then subscribe from that snapshot cursor.

## Retention and migration

Stream readers expose their earliest retained sequence. A retention gap is never represented as a synthetic event or sparse sequence. Legacy sparse workbench logs are archived into a pre-dense epoch and new streams begin from sequence 1.

The transient-conversation-events migration archives prior conversation journals and installs an empty high-water barrier above each old stream. This deliberately makes every pre-migration conversation cursor require one fresh snapshot without adding a runtime compatibility path or renumbering future durable events.
