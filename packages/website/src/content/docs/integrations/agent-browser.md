Nerve can discover skills by invoking the installed `agent-browser` CLI and reading its skill catalog. Enable selected entries in Settings to append their `SKILL.md` guidance to subsequent agent runs.

Agent Browser entries follow normal skill toggling and cannot override same-named file skills that already won resource precedence.

:::note[Important distinction]
This integration is prompt guidance, not a native Nerve browser automation tool. There is no `agent_browser` entry in the agent tool manifest and no Nerve browser-control executor. Any workflow described by the skill depends on external CLI capabilities and the agent's permitted command execution.
:::

Review imported skill instructions before enabling them, especially when they ask for authentication, downloads, or state-changing browser actions.
