# Nerve website

Static marketing and documentation site for [nerve.tlmtech.dev](https://nerve.tlmtech.dev), built with Astro and Starlight.

## Authoring

Public prose lives in `src/content/docs/`. Keep guides task-oriented and put exact catalogs or limits in reference pages. The evidence inventory and page backlog live in [`content-strategy.md`](content-strategy.md). Architecture sources live in `diagrams/` and their generated SVGs live in `public/diagrams/`.

```sh
pnpm --filter @nervekit/website dev
pnpm --filter @nervekit/website check
pnpm --filter @nervekit/website build
```

## Design system

The site uses Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`) plus `@astrojs/starlight-tailwind`. Styles are layered under `src/styles/` and loaded once through Starlight's `customCss`:

- `app.css` — the only entry: Tailwind, the Starlight bridge, fonts, then the partials below.
- `tokens.css` — brand tokens for both themes, the Myelin marketing layer, semantic radius/depth/rhythm values, the `@theme inline` mapping, and the `--sl-*` bridge. The shared Nerve light/dark semantic palette mirrors `packages/ui-kit/src/styles/theme.css`, which stays the source of truth; marketing-only roles extend it without overriding shared values.
- `base.css` — element defaults, focus rings, and native view transitions.
- `motion.css` — every `@keyframes` in this package, progressive reveals, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.
- `neural.css` — reusable neural/depth primitives such as membranes, axons, event layers, labels, and 3D stages.
- `marketing.css` — repeated marketing surfaces (typography roles, buttons, cards, and the shared page container).
- `starlight.css` — documentation shell overrides, including equal fixed desktop navigation/TOC rails.

Rules to keep:

- Use tokens (`var(--primary)`, `var(--hairline)`, `var(--radius-card)`) and Tailwind token utilities. Marketing-only colour roles belong in the documented Myelin layer rather than individual components.
- `.container-page` owns the outer geometry of every landing section through `--container-max` and `--page-gutter`. Do not add compensating per-section left/right margins.
- Add keyframes only to `motion.css`, and animate only `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, or `stroke-dashoffset`.
- The landing page has one motion language, "signal propagation", built from four primitives in `src/scripts/motion/stage/primitives.ts`: masked line reveals (P1), depth settle (P2), an impulse conducting a real path (P3), and bounded scrub parallax (P4). Prefer composing those over inventing a new effect for one section.
- Motion has three categories: static-first arrivals, the single pinned Anatomy stage, and diagram loops that pause off-screen. Do not make ordinary section geometry remain fractional when scrolling pauses.
- Every animation must degrade under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, and every page must remain fully readable with JavaScript disabled. Hidden reveal states are permitted only beneath the `data-motion-ready` root marker, which `MarketingLayout` sets before first paint and clears again if the stage never reports `data-stage-ready`.
- Elements that compose a transform from custom properties (`--tilt-*`, `--deck-*`, `--layer-*`, `--stage-parallax`) must be animated through those properties, never through `transform` directly.
- Client behavior lives in `src/scripts/`: `motion/index.ts` is the critical path (theme, header state, copy buttons, carousel, tilt) and dynamically imports `motion/stage/index.ts`, which owns GSAP and every scroll-linked stage (`hero`, `anatomy`, `tour`, `diagrams`, `sections`). GSAP is never on the path to a readable page, and is not fetched at all under reduced motion. Theme state shares Starlight's `starlight-theme` storage key so marketing and docs stay in sync.

The site is static and must not call a local Nerve daemon. GitHub Pages deployment is part of the tagged release workflow. `public/CNAME` sets the custom domain; DNS is managed separately in Cloudflare.

## Content ownership

- Public user and developer documentation: this package.
- Public prose, architecture sources, lifecycle/reliability guidance, and generated diagram assets: this package.
- Release engineering and performance-profiling workflows: root `docs/`.
- Repository governance: root `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
- Behavioral authority: owning contracts, catalogs, implementation, and tests.

## Product screenshots

Landing-page captures come from the live loopback workbench at desktop and phone viewports. The current approved set covers conversation, Git, pull requests, tasks, conversation history, model control, and dock sheets. Before committing a frame, select only the public `nerve` project, hide unrelated project shortcuts, avoid authentication/settings panes, and inspect the image for tokens, private paths, account details, or other project names.

Optimized WebP sources live in `src/assets/screenshots/{desktop,mobile}/`; Astro generates responsive variants at build time. Keep descriptive alt text on every use when adding or retiring a frame.
