# Nerve public website: content-first implementation plan

> **Editorial status (2026-07-29):** Evidence inventory reviewed against the implementation; first-pass public copy drafted in `packages/website/src/content/docs/`; final product-owner copy review and production screenshot refresh remain before declaring the corpus stable.

## Objective and outcome

Create a private workspace package, `packages/website`, for a static public site at `https://nerve.tlmtech.dev`. The site will combine a concise marketing homepage with comprehensive, task-oriented product and developer documentation. Content discovery and claim correction come first; visual customization remains intentionally minimal until the documentation corpus is coherent and reviewed.

This plan supersedes the earlier “strategy only” boundary because the product owner explicitly approved beginning the website package, while retaining the requirement that content quality take priority over styling.

## Decisions

### Framework

Use **Astro 7.1.5 + Starlight 0.41.5** with static output.

- **Chosen: Starlight with a custom Astro homepage.** It provides accessible documentation navigation, full-text search, table of contents, Markdown/MDX, code rendering, mobile behavior, SEO metadata, and linkable headings without building a documentation shell. A custom `src/pages/index.astro` supplies a focused marketing page.
- **Rejected: fully custom Astro documentation UI.** It offers more visual control but would spend the first iteration on navigation, search, accessibility, and responsive behavior rather than content.
- **Rejected: a second-site generator or root `docs/` GitHub Pages source.** This would either add an unnecessary framework mismatch or mix deployable website source with repository engineering documents. GitHub Pages does not require root `docs/`.

Use exact package versions consistent with repository conventions: `astro@7.1.5`, `@astrojs/starlight@0.41.5`, `@astrojs/check@0.9.10`, and `@astrojs/sitemap@3.7.3`. Astro 7 supports the repository’s Node 24 baseline; Starlight 0.41.5 declares Astro 7 compatibility.

### Hosting and URL

- Publish through GitHub Pages as part of the tagged Release workflow.
- Set Astro `site` to `https://nerve.tlmtech.dev` with no `base` path.
- Add `packages/website/public/CNAME` containing `nerve.tlmtech.dev`.
- External setup required after merge: configure Cloudflare DNS `nerve` as a CNAME to `thilinatlm.github.io` (DNS-only while GitHub validates), choose **GitHub Actions** as the Pages source, set the custom domain, then enable HTTPS. These are deployment operations, not repository code.

### Content ownership

- `packages/website/src/content/docs/` is canonical for all public user, operations, integration, troubleshooting, architecture, protocol, and developer-reference prose.
- `packages/website/diagrams/` owns editable architecture sources; generated SVGs in `packages/website/public/diagrams/` are website assets.
- `packages/website/content-strategy.md` records the evidence inventory, editorial priorities, migration map, known claim constraints, and page backlog. It is package planning material, not a public page.
- Root `docs/` is reserved for maintainer and development workflow documents such as release engineering and performance profiling.
- `README.md` remains a concise repository landing page and quick start. It links to the website for detail instead of duplicating guides.
- Source schemas, catalogs, implementation, and focused tests remain authoritative for changing API/tool/limit behavior. Public prose explains those behaviors but is not an independent schema catalog.

### Initial editorial scope

Publish comprehensive first-pass pages, not placeholder stubs. Where behavior remains uncertain, make the initial copy conservative and explicit rather than publishing broad capability claims. Add no blog, analytics, newsletter, CMS, internationalization, version switcher, or elaborate animation in this phase.

## Evidence-backed feature inventory

This package-level inventory is the durable editorial source. Priorities are **P0** (getting started, safety, or defining value), **P1** (important daily workflow), and **P2** (advanced/reference).

## Audience and journey taxonomy

Organize navigation by what readers are trying to accomplish, not by package or implementation feature.

1. **Evaluators** — “What is Nerve, why is it different, does it fit my security/workflow needs?” Journey: homepage → capabilities → local-first/security → install.
2. **First-time users** — “Install it, connect a model, open a project, complete a safe first task.” Journey: install → provider auth → first project → first conversation → approvals/review.
3. **Daily practitioners** — “Use the composer, conversations, Git, tasks, skills, suggestions, and recovery efficiently.” Journey: workflow guides linked contextually rather than one giant feature tour.
4. **Integrators/power users** — “Enable network/data integrations, custom providers, browser/mobile access, or remote topology.” Journey: integration prerequisites → configuration → permissions/security → troubleshooting.
5. **Operators/security-conscious users** — “Know where data lives, what is exposed, how auth/migration/cleanup/diagnostics work.” Journey: advanced operation → security model → storage → troubleshooting.
6. **Contributors/extension authors** — “Understand architecture, protocol, contracts, tools, package boundaries, and contribution/release expectations.” Journey: architecture → extension model/protocol → development → repository governance.

Each public page starts with who it is for and the outcome, then prerequisites, steps/concepts, constraints/warnings, and next links. Package names appear only in developer pages.

## Information architecture

### Marketing homepage (`/`)

1. Hero: “A transparent, local-first coding harness” with install command and docs/GitHub calls to action.
2. Product proof: current workbench screenshot and the three differentiators—transparent execution, live control, local ownership.
3. Core workflow: open project → direct agent → review tools/approvals → inspect changes/PR/tasks.
4. Capability groups: workbench, agent control, integrations, Git/tasks, model choice.
5. Local-first topology diagram and concise security caveat.
6. Open-source/beta/platform statement.
7. Final quick-start call to action.

Avoid unsupported comparative claims, exhaustive provider logos, fabricated testimonials, download buttons for nonexistent installers, or “fully sandboxed/private” language.

Duplicate-source rules:

1. Public procedures and architecture explanations live only in website Markdown; README links to them.
2. Maintainer release and development profiling workflows live only in root `docs/`; the website links or summarizes them without copying operational secrets.
3. Protocol, tool, and storage prose lives in the website tree; TypeScript schemas, catalogs, implementation, and tests define changing behavior.
4. Editable architecture sources and generated visuals live together in the website package; generated assets must be regenerated when a source diagram changes.
5. Tables likely to drift (tools, shortcuts, env vars) must cite the owning symbols and be rechecked during relevant code reviews.

## Known gaps and conservative initial-copy resolutions

| Some provider lists are capped at eight                   | Document this as a current catalog limitation and troubleshoot custom model definitions where appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| “Live configuration changes”                              | Limit the claim to agent model/thinking/mode/permission changes applying to subsequent work; do not say every server setting hot-reloads. Mention Python runtime path as the confirmed immediate refresh.                                                                     |

Before polishing final marketing copy, product ownership can later decide whether to formalize a provider support matrix, add model-modality gating, define a stronger web-fetch network boundary, expose crash reports in UI, or broaden editor support. The first site does not depend on those future decisions.

## Implementation steps

### 1. Create the editorial source of truth first

Maintain `packages/website/content-strategy.md` as the evidence inventory, audience taxonomy, IA, backlog, cleanup map, known constraints, screenshot checklist, and page-status record (`not started`, `drafted`, `evidence reviewed`, `copy reviewed`, `published`). Keep `docs/README.md` as the short root ownership index.

This commit stage makes claim review possible before visual work and ensures another writer can trace every important statement to implementation.

### 2. Scaffold the private static-site workspace

Create:

- `packages/website/package.json` (`@nervekit/website`, private, Node >=24; scripts `dev`, `build`, `check`, `preview`)
- `packages/website/astro.config.mjs` (static output, `site`, Starlight, sitemap, title/description, GitHub/social/edit links, sidebar)
- `packages/website/tsconfig.json`
- `packages/website/src/content.config.ts`
- `packages/website/README.md` (authoring, ownership, local commands, deployment, screenshot guidance)
- `packages/website/public/CNAME`
- minimal brand assets copied from canonical root `assets/brand` only where Astro public delivery requires them

Keep the package independent of contracts, UI kit, Svelte, and runtime packages. The website documents the product; it does not import product runtime code into the static build.

### 3. Build a minimal, content-led homepage and theme

Create `src/pages/index.astro`, a few small semantic Astro components under `src/components/`, and one minimal custom stylesheet under `src/styles/`.

- Reuse the Nerve mark and existing screenshots.
- Use Starlight’s typography/navigation behavior and accessible defaults.
- Limit custom design to brand tokens, readable content widths, a simple hero, capability grid, screenshot frame, topology section, and responsive spacing.
- Support light/dark mode through Starlight; no JavaScript animation, carousel, decorative canvas, custom component system, or duplicated workbench UI kit.
- Ensure all calls to action work without JavaScript and all screenshots have useful alt text.

### 4. Write Start Here and core daily-workflow pages

Write complete prose for all Start Here pages and the P0/P1 daily workflow pages in the backlog. Use tested command examples and concise task-oriented procedures. Capture or reuse screenshots only after page structure is stable. Every behavioral claim must be checked against the evidence inventory.

The first coherent review slice is:

1. Homepage
2. Install
3. Provider setup
4. First project and first task
5. Workbench
6. Composer
7. Agent controls and reviews
8. Conversations/history/recovery
9. Git/PRs
10. Background tasks

### 5. Write models, integrations, and advanced operation

Add provider/model/auth pages, then integration pages with prerequisites and explicit network/credential boundaries. Add browser/PWA, LAN/mobile, remote-daemon, configuration, storage/migration, security, and diagnostics pages. Prefer diagrams for topology and trust boundaries over extra decoration.

### 6. Write troubleshooting and reference

Convert existing README troubleshooting into symptom-oriented pages, correcting migration behavior and retaining platform-specific shell examples. Build exact reference tables from owning source symbols:

- CLI/env from desktop/server parsers and profile builders
- shortcuts from `DEFAULT_SHORTCUTS`
- tool inventory from contracts/catalog manifest
- resource precedence from `resource-loader.ts`
- suggestion schema from server parser/tests
- paths/formats from storage/export/transcription implementations

### 7. Migrate public docs and correct engineering drift

- Move prompt suggestions, tasks, protocol v1, and public screenshots to their canonical website locations.
- Update all repository links before deleting obsolete public-doc files.
- Correct `README.md` migration wording, notes/fork terminology where retained, protocol ACK wording, and links to the new site.
- Keep ACK wording in `packages/website/diagrams/01-system-context.puml`, `02-package-dependencies.puml`, and `03-desktop-runtime.puml` aligned with Protocol v1 and current contracts.
- Correct any release/native-validation overclaims in `docs/runbooks/release.md` and `/developers/platform-reliability/` to match current workflows.
- Preserve only release and performance-profiling workflow documents in root `docs/`; public architecture and lifecycle material belongs to the website package.

### 8. Add GitHub Pages deployment

Add the website build and deployment jobs to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

- deploy only from the stable and prerelease version tags handled by the release workflow, not from ordinary `main` pushes;
- grant `contents: read`, `pages: write`, and `id-token: write` only to the Pages jobs;
- keep a `github-pages` concurrency group with in-progress cancellation;
- checkout, use pnpm 11.20.0 and Node 24, and install the frozen root workspace;
- run `pnpm --filter @nervekit/website check` and `build` after release validation;
- upload `packages/website/dist` with `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and deploy with `actions/deploy-pages` after npm publication;
- use the `github-pages` environment and expose the deployment URL.

Do not modify the existing CI workflow’s permissions for deployment. Root CI will naturally include website package checks/tests through recursive scripts.

### 9. Review content before visual polish

Review in this order:

1. **Evidence review:** implementation owner validates claims/limits and all warnings.
2. **Journey review:** a new user can install, authenticate, open a project, supervise a task, and recover from a common failure without reading architecture pages.
3. **Security review:** tokens, OAuth, network tools, LAN, Python, JavaScript suggestions, destructive Git, storage, and logs are accurately bounded.
4. **Editorial review:** terminology is consistent; concepts are introduced before reference detail; no page is a package/file inventory disguised as a guide.
5. **Visual review:** only then capture final light/dark desktop and compact/mobile screenshots and adjust minimal styling.

## Validation

During implementation, validate incrementally with focused package commands, then run the repository-required full chain before completion.

1. `pnpm --filter @nervekit/website check`
2. `pnpm --filter @nervekit/website build`
3. Preview the built site and manually verify:
   - homepage and all sidebar routes;
   - search indexing;
   - internal links, heading anchors, code copy controls, 404;
   - canonical URLs, sitemap, robots metadata, favicon/social metadata, and `CNAME` in output;
   - keyboard navigation, visible focus, semantic heading order, image alt text;
   - light/dark and widths around 1440, 1024, 768, and 390 px;
   - no request to localhost/runtime APIs from the static site.
4. Review command snippets on Linux syntax and retain separate PowerShell blocks where needed.
5. Grep for stale/high-risk phrases: wire “ACK,” “scratch notes in tabs,” generic “file upload,” “all pi-ai providers,” “sandboxed,” “safe public Internet,” and old migration exclusions.
6. Run in one Bash invocation: `pnpm fix && pnpm check && pnpm run test:full`. Fix failures and rerun the complete chain.
7. Run `pnpm build` to verify the website composes with all workspace builds and the existing workbench asset staging step.
8. After repository merge and external Pages/DNS setup, verify `https://nerve.tlmtech.dev`, HTTPS certificate issuance, redirect/canonical behavior, sitemap/search assets, and a clean browser load.

## Risks and mitigations

- **Scope/content volume:** Do not trade accuracy for page count. Write in the ordered review slices above; no empty pages are deployed. The IA can contain only pages that have complete first-pass copy at launch.
- **Rapid product drift:** Keep the evidence matrix and symbol owners; require docs updates in code reviews that change user-visible contracts, tool catalogs, shortcuts, CLI flags, or storage behavior.
- **Duplicate sources:** Complete moves atomically with link updates and deletion of old public prose. Root documents summarize/link rather than mirror.
- **Custom-domain outage:** GitHub Pages configuration and Cloudflare DNS are external prerequisites. The built artifact remains valid at the Pages deployment URL while DNS validates, but canonical metadata targets `nerve.tlmtech.dev`.
- **Protocol status overstatement:** Retain explicit implementation-status/coverage pages and qualify package-test evidence versus end-to-end compatibility.
- **Security marketing risk:** Never equate local-first with offline-only, permissions with sandboxing, self-signed HTTPS with Internet-safe exposure, or encrypted credential storage with zero trust.
- **Screenshot churn:** Use existing images for first drafts, maintain a shot list, and capture final assets only after workflows and page sections settle.
- **Framework over-customization:** Use Starlight defaults and small Astro components; postpone bespoke visual systems until content and navigation have user feedback.

## Phased content-writing and review plan

1. **Phase A — inventory and terminology (first artifact):** maintain `packages/website/content-strategy.md`, correct high-risk factual drift, establish canonical ownership and glossary.
2. **Phase B — successful first hour:** homepage + Start Here + agent controls/reviews. Review with a clean-home user journey.
3. **Phase C — daily coding workflow:** workbench, composer, conversation history, context/files/notes, Git/PRs, tasks, skills/suggestions, import/export. Review against UI and focused tests.
4. **Phase D — models and integrations:** auth, model scopes/thinking/usage, custom providers, media/voice, Web/Python/Atlassian/Agent Browser/editors. Review credentials, data flow, and provider limitations.
5. **Phase E — operation and safety:** browser/PWA, LAN/mobile, remote daemon, configuration, storage/migration, diagnostics, security. Perform dedicated security and migration review.
6. **Phase F — troubleshooting and reference:** symptom pages, exact tables, protocol v1 migration/corrections, contributor architecture. Validate source symbols and links.
7. **Phase G — publish and learn:** deploy to GitHub Pages/custom domain, verify production, collect issue feedback, then decide whether richer homepage styling, videos, changelog/versioning, or translations are justified.

Website implementation begins in Phase B only after Phase A’s inventory artifact is written; within each later phase, prose and evidence review precede screenshot polish and layout customization.
